# My AWS learning projects

I write documentation in this repository for my learning projects which are related to Amazon Web Services.

## DVDStore

This project contains the DVD Store (<https://github.com/dvdstore/ds3>) web application which simulate a real world webstore with test workload.
My documentation will contain deployment and configuration guide on AWS from single server to highly available, scale-out version with monitoring, logging, backup with command line and configuration management methods as the example customer migrates from on premises environment to the cloud.
