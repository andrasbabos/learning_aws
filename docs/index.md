# My AWS learning projects

I write documentation in this repository for my learning projects which are related to Amazon Web Services.

The code for this webpage is available at: <https://github.com/andrasbabos/learning_aws>

## static page

(more or less finished)

Static webpage generated from markdown files with Material for MkDocs, hosted from S3 bucket with cloudfront, DNS provided by Route53, pipeline uses various AWS services and esources deployed via terraform.

The example for this project is the webpage: <https://learing-aws.andrasb.link>

## DVDStore

(on-hold, unfinished)

This project contains the DVD Store (<https://github.com/dvdstore/ds3>) web application which simulate a real world webstore with test workload.
My documentation will contain deployment and configuration guide on AWS from single server to highly available, scale-out version with monitoring, logging, backup with command line and configuration management methods as the example customer migrates from on premises environment to the cloud.
